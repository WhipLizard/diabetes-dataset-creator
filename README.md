# Diabetes Dataset Creator

A Python-based tool for generating synthetic diabetes datasets using configurable parameters like glucose levels, diastolic pressure, triceps skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes pedigree function (DPF), and age. This project is useful for machine learning enthusiasts, researchers, and students to create data for training and testing AI models related to diabetes prediction.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Generates synthetic diabetes datasets with realistic ranges for key health indicators.
- Includes key parameters like:
  - **Glucose Levels**
  - **Diastolic Pressure**
  - **Triceps Skin Thickness**
  - **Insulin Levels**
  - **BMI (Body Mass Index)**
  - **Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF)**
  - **Age**
- Saves generated data into a CSV file for easy integration into machine learning projects.
- Automatically labels data as `Diabetic` or `Non-Diabetic` based on predefined thresholds.
